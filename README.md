# School_District_Analysis
 The students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. We have to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.

## Purpose of Project
We have to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we have replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

1.Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores

2.Repeat the school district analysis


## Results
There is not much change in the overall analysis as the dataset is very large changing only the 9th grade data from the Thomas High School does not alter the overall result of the analysis.

## Summary
The removal of data implies a decrease in the count of total students overall, and total students at Thomas High School, specifically for this analysis. And since the student count was decreased, this leads to a change in average scores and score percentages. Due to the fact that these score and percentage changes were minimal, we can say that the removal of math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School not as significant as we would imagine it to be.
